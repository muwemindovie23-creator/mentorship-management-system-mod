# Menty

A production-ready web application for managing the Faculty of Engineering
mentorship programme: mentor/mentee registration with admin approval,
automated pairing, internal messaging (with email & WhatsApp quick actions),
meeting logs, semester cohorts, announcements, bulk email, CSV import/export
and analytics — presented as a modern SaaS dashboard with light/dark mode.

## Features

### Roles & approval workflow
- Three roles: **Admin**, **Mentor**, **Mentee**.
- Self-service registration; every new account is **Pending Approval**.
- Only admins approve/reject; only approved accounts can log in.
- Email notifications on registration, approval and rejection.

### Automatic pairing
Runs immediately when a mentee is approved and retries whenever a new
mentor becomes available. Priority order:
1. Same department (hard filter if the mentee requested it)
2. Shared interests
3. Mentor availability (free slots + weekly hours)
4. Random tie-break

Mentor capacity is never exceeded (checked again inside a transaction).
Unmatched mentees are waitlisted and admins are notified by email and
in-app notification.

### Admin dashboard
Overview stats (mentors, mentees, active semester, waitlist, pending
approvals, pairing & meeting statistics), user management with search and
filters, manual pairing/reassignment, semester management (create /
activate / archive / open / close registration), announcements, bulk
email, CSV import/export, analytics, messaging and global search.

### Mentor & mentee dashboards
Assigned mentees/mentor with contact info, meeting history and logging,
upcoming meetings, messages, announcements and profile editing.

### Messaging
Internal 1:1 messaging with unread counts, read/unread toggling,
conversation search and quick actions to **Send Email** (mailto) and
**Open WhatsApp** (wa.me link generated from the recipient's phone).

### Communication (Gmail SMTP)
Automated emails for registration, approval, pairing, weekly reminders
(Vercel cron, Mondays), meeting reminders (daily cron) and announcements.

### Security
Role-based authorization (edge middleware + server-side guards), CSRF
protection via Auth.js, bcrypt password hashing, secure JWT sessions,
route protection, rate limiting on sensitive endpoints, input
sanitization and HTML-escaped email templates, security headers.
